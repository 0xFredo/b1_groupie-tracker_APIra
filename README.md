## How to launch

To launch the game, you'll first need to download and install Go :
       https://go.dev/dl/

Next, download & extract this repo.

Finally, open your system Terminal in the extracted directory and type/copy-paste the following command:

       go run main.go

...the game will open in your default web brower. Enjoy! :)

## Troubleshooting

### Bizarre text/page formatting

→ Clear your localhost website data.

### Can't connect to localhost

→ Try refreshing the page. If this doesn't work, go back to your Terminal and continue reading this section.

### (Terminal) No such file or directory

→ Make sure you have extracted the repo correctly and that you are in the correct folder (`groupie-tracker`).

### (Terminal) Command not found

→ You didn't correctly install Go. Repeat the first step.

### Any other error

→ Restart your PC.
